probe means to check. A probe is a health check that Kubernetes performs on containers. Three types of probes:

1-StartupProbe
2-ReadinessProbe
3-LivenessProbe
StartupProbe — Is the container started? K8S will direct traffic to the pod only if startupProbe passes.
StartupProbe is a signal whether an app or container has successfully started.

If this probe is setup, k8s will ignore the other probes (livenss and readiness) until the startup probe succeeds.

if startupPorbe fails, it wont check readinessProbe and livenessProbe.

Scenarios where to use startupProbe:

Purpose: Checks if the container has successfully started — beyond just being alive or ready for traffic.

Acts as a gate: Kubernetes disables readiness and liveness checks until the startup probe succeeds.
Once it passes once, the other probes resume functioning.
When to use StartupProbe?

Slow-start apps (e.g., JVM, Python with DB migrations, large assets, cache warmup) hackernoon.com+15kubernetes.io+15thelinuxcode.com+15kubeops.net+10engineering-blog.eden-reich.com+10dev.to+10
Heavy initialization tasks (compilation, large file loading, ML model warm-up)
Waiting for external dependencies (DBs, caches, services) or downstream apps to be reachable. May be webserver is communicating to backend database.
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 30
ports:
- name: http
  containerPort: 8081
  protocol: TCP

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: http

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /
    port: http
port: http refers to the named port 8081 specified under ports.
HTTP probes (liveness/readiness) send GETs to / by default — success = stable, failure = restart or withdraw from traffic.
What it does: Kubelet issues an HTTP GET to http://<pod-ip>:8081/ (because “http” maps to port 8081).
Healthy response: Any HTTP status code in the range 200–399.
The probes check the root path / — ensure your app responds here with 2xx/3xx. If not, the default is a 404 → unhealthy.
